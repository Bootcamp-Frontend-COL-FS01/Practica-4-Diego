    <h1>Tic Tac Toe :)</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome guests! Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that is typically
      played on a 3x3 grid. The game is also known as "noughts and crosses" or
      "Xs and Os".
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is played by two players who take turns marking spaces on the
      grid with their respective symbols. Player 1 typically uses "X" as their
      symbol while player 2 uses "O". The objective of the game is to get three
      of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

        <p>
          A good strategy for player 1 in Tic Tac Toe is to start by placing
          their first "O" mark in the center square of the grid. This move
          provides the greatest number of options for creating a winning
          pattern, as it allows for the possibility of creating a row of three
          symbols in any direction.

          A good strategy for player 2 in Tic Tac Toe is to start by placing
          their first "X" mark in one of the corner squares of the grid. This
          move creates more potential winning patterns for player 2, as it
          allows for the possibility of creating two diagonal patterns and one
          horizontal or vertical pattern.
